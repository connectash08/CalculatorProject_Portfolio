# CalculatorProject_Portfolio

This project is a Python-based symbolic math calculator that can perform basic, calculus, and trig related operations along with graphing capabilities using sympy, numpy, and matplotlib. It allows users to solve equations, perform calc operations, simplify trig expressions, and graph various equations via a command-line interface.

--------

## Features
- Solve Algebraic Equations
- Perform differentiation and integration (indefinite and definite)
- Simplify and solve trigonometric expressions
- Graph mathematical expressions using Matplotlib

--------

## Skills demonstrated

- Python programming and GUI design.
- Converting equations into 'symbolic' ones for computation
- Calculus and algebraic manipulation
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Input handling & debugging
- User interaction

--------

This project was created with the help of coding tutorials, but the code design & structure was done by me. I got this idea from my own experiences in Calculus & Trig and to showcase my data handling & manipulation skills.

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install sympy matpoltlib numpy
